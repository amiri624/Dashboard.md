# Create a dashboard for Linux hosts in an organizer
```bash
This tutorial shows how to create a dashboard dedicated to the Linux hosts found in a Collection Zone organizer. If you have not already created any organizers, use the procedures on this page to create at least one, and then come back.

In this tutorial, all the hosts are virtual machines running on the same vSphere hypervisor host. It's OK if your hosts are not virtual machines, but they do need to be Linux hosts.

The following example shows the result of this tutorial.
